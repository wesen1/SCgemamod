This project will be completely converted into a new version, then this repository will be deleted.

Note:
* The V2 version had a failed git commit, the source files are all gone (hard disk was reformatted multiple times before recognizing the mistake)

# Gema Maps
A list of maps (including a lot of gema maps) can be found here:

# Ideas:

- save log
- anti spam (chat and sendmap)
- server ideas:
  * quality assurance : only moderators/admins can upload new maps to other servers than map upload server
  * map upload server  (all maps deleted every day)
* create a web interface for map- and gtops

# Special thanks to:

- +f0r3v3r+ and .45|Todesgurke for trusting me enough to give me an admin password for their servers
- boss and Arisu-chan for playing gemas with me
