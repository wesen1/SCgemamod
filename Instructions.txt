How to set up a local lua server at a PC at your home : 

1) Install Ubuntu and adjust it that it doesn't go in standby mode after some time of idling.
2) Download AssaultCube for Linux from http://assault.cubers.net/download.html
3) Extract the content of the downloaded file
4) Download Lua Mod for AssaultCube from http://www.mirari.fr/fvtk
5) Extract this file to the same folder you have the AssaultCube game files. Replace existing files by the new ones.
6) Now open a terminal and type "sudo apt-get install assaultcube", so you get the necessary libraries installed
7) For the Lua mod you will also need to type "sudo apt-get install lib32stdc++6 lib32z1"
8) Finally you will have to forward the port that is set in /config/servercmdline.txt and the port following that number
9) Now the server is prepared, you can edit the server config files in /config and place a lua mod in /lua/scripts
10) To start your server open a terminal, navigate to the folder in which you saved the files (using "cd 'path/to/files'") and type "./server.sh"


Virtualbox :

You can also use Virtualbox to create a server, in that case you don't have to install the OS on your real PC. You can follow the guide above, you only have to set the network type to bridged networking additionally.

For a better performance you can install LXDE, a lightweight desktop environment, by typing "sudo apt-get install lxde". The virtual PC should run smoother with LXDE and use less resources. This might be useful if you want to run it on the same PC you use to play the game.

You can use shared folders to edit the lua files with a windows tool and only use the virtualbox to run the server

1.) Create a shared folder
2.) in Linux terminal type 'sudo mount -t vboxsf "your shared folder name" "path where the folder content should be placed in the virtual pc"'
3.) When you got the right command, copy and paste it to /etc/rc.local, this will start that command automatically on system start


Lua Mod:

Thanks to internet archive you can still check out the documentation of the lua server commands. You can find it here : https://web.archive.org/web/20111102112829/http://sveark.info/ac/Lua/

I recommend downloading a lua mod and trying to understand how it works. That way I learned how to use lua and how to get rid of functions I didn't like.

How to install this lua mod :

Copy the geoip folder to lua/config/
Copy the gemamod.lua file to /lua/scripts/
